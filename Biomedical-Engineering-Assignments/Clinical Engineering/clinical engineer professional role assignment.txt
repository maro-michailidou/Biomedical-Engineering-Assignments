Assignment: 
The lecturer had asked us to define the role of a clinical engineer based on online conferences and webinars from biomedican engineers. 

Answer:
A short summary of the speakers's opinions can be given as an answer to the above question since the speakers represent international biomedical engineering organisations and are quite experienced in the field themselves. Leandro Pecchia notes the significance of biomedical engineering being included in the European skill competence database, which marks an important milestone for professional recognition and further ensures the effectiveness of EU healthcare regulatory standards, while mentioning that the International Legal Organization seeks to have biomedical engineering recognized in the United Nations' repository for jobs and skills as well. Yadin David addressed the impact of global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, stressing the need for disaster planning in the health sector and the role of clinical engineers in that matter. Ricardo Silva mentions that a clinical engineer's role should be the collaboration with IT professionals and assurance of cybersecurity and quality of medical equipment and software used. After hearing all these distinguished proffesionals, my view on the matter, is that a clinical engineer plays a crucial part in healthcare settings, having a serious technical and management position of ensuring all medical equipment is fit to be used by personnel, arranging for possible maintenance and examination of proper function of the medical devices, as well as organising the future medical equipment acquisition, by having a concrete long term plan which benefits their place of employment in a logistical and medical manner.
